# Dual Motor Driver with LM18200
This project provides an easy way to control two independent motors using PWM.
The H-bridges used are LM18200 which provides up to 3A continuous output for each motor.

Each motor can be controlled with three signals:
* DIR - define the direction of rotation of the motor
* BRK - break the motor by shorting its terminals
* PWM - control the speed of the motor

All the components used are PTH and the board is single sided.
